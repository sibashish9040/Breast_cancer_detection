# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses **scikit-learn's built-in breast cancer dataset** and applies **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## 🔍 Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. Early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. In this project, we use a logistic regression model — a popular classification algorithm — to build a basic prediction system.
